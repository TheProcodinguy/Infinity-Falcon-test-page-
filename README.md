# Infinity-Falcon-test-page-
Hey there! I'm a young aspiring frontend dev (I really don't know much XD) feel free to make edits to the project.
If anybody know how to get this stuff in the center, do let me know.
Status update: Till know I have figured out how to get the hero image positioned :). And I'm using the font 'roboto'
Here is a lin to the page infinity-falcon.pages.dev
